# Project Cleanup Summary

## Files Removed

### Docker Development Files
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Removed as not needed for production deployment

### Monitoring Stack
- `monitoring/` directory - Removed entire monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana)
- `monitoring/prometheus.yml` - Prometheus configuration
- `monitoring/grafana/` - Grafana dashboards and datasources

### Database Files
- `backups/backup_20250723_194356.db` - Old database backup (2.7MB)
- Note: `atc_optimization.db-wal` and `atc_optimization.db-shm` are locked by running application

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Simplified Deployment**: Removed unnecessary development and monitoring files
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Single Docker Compose file for production
3. **Cleaner Structure**: Organized files into logical directories
4. **Smaller Repository**: Removed large backup files and monitoring configs
5. **Focused Functionality**: Core VATSIM data collection system only

## Next Steps

1. Stop the running application to clean up database lock files
2. Consider migrating to PostgreSQL for better performance
3. Use Docker for production deployment
4. Monitor system performance and logs

## Remaining Files to Consider

- Database files (`atc_optimization.db*`) - Will be cleaned when app stops
- Documentation files - May be consolidated
- Migration scripts - Keep for PostgreSQL transition

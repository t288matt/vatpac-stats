# ATC Service Coverage Index Optimization

## Overview
This document outlines the database index optimizations implemented to support the ATC Service Coverage Analysis Grafana dashboard. The optimizations target the complex queries that join `transceivers`, `controllers`, and `flights` tables to calculate ATC service coverage percentages.

## Problem Analysis

### Query Complexity
The ATC coverage queries use sophisticated Common Table Expressions (CTEs) with:
- **Complex JOINs**: Frequency matching between flight and ATC transceivers
- **Time Window Filtering**: 180-second (3-minute) time windows for matching
- **Distance Calculations**: Geographic distance constraints (300 coordinate units)
- **Entity Type Filtering**: Separating flight vs ATC transceivers
- **Facility Filtering**: Excluding observers (`facility != 'OBS'`)

### Performance Bottlenecks Identified
1. **Sequential Scans**: On `transceivers` table filtering by `entity_type`
2. **Inefficient JOINs**: Frequency matching without proper composite indexes
3. **Subquery Performance**: EXISTS clauses for flight record counting
4. **Missing Selective Indexes**: No indexes on key filter columns

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Transceivers Table Indexes

#### Primary Entity Type Index
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_transceivers_entity_type ON transceivers(entity_type);
```
- **Purpose**: Eliminates sequential scans for `entity_type = 'flight'` and `entity_type = 'atc'`
- **Impact**: Critical for CTE performance (flight_transceivers, atc_transceivers)

#### Composite Frequency Matching Indexes
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_transceivers_flight_frequency_timestamp 
ON transceivers(entity_type, frequency, timestamp) 
WHERE entity_type = 'flight';

CREATE INDEX idx_transceivers_atc_frequency_timestamp 
ON transceivers(entity_type, frequency, timestamp) 
WHERE entity_type = 'atc';
```
- **Purpose**: Optimizes frequency matching JOINs with time constraints
- **Impact**: Dramatically improves performance of frequency_matches CTE

#### Position-Based Filtering
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_transceivers_position_lat_lon 
ON transceivers(position_lat, position_lon) 
WHERE position_lat IS NOT NULL AND position_lon IS NOT NULL;
```
- **Purpose**: Speeds up geographic distance calculations
- **Impact**: Optimizes WHERE clause distance filtering

#### Multi-Column Composite Index
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_transceivers_freq_pos_time 
ON transceivers(frequency, position_lat, position_lon, timestamp);
```
- **Purpose**: Single index covering frequency matching, position, and time
- **Impact**: Reduces index lookups for complex JOIN conditions

### 2. Controllers Table Indexes

#### Facility Filtering Index
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_controllers_facility_callsign 
ON controllers(facility, callsign) 
WHERE facility != 'OBS';
```
- **Purpose**: Optimizes observer exclusion filtering
- **Impact**: Eliminates full table scans for ATC controller identification

#### Position Classification Index
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_controllers_position 
ON controllers(position) 
WHERE position IS NOT NULL;
```
- **Purpose**: Speeds up position type classification (FSS, CTR, APP, TWR, GND, DEL)
- **Impact**: Optimizes CASE statements in position-based analysis

### 3. Flights Table Indexes

#### Flight Record Counting Optimization
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_flights_callsign_last_updated_count 
ON flights(callsign, last_updated);
```
- **Purpose**: Optimizes flight record counting by callsign
- **Impact**: Critical for flight_records_total and flight_records_with_atc CTEs

#### Time-Based Query Optimization
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_flights_last_updated_desc 
ON flights(last_updated DESC);
```
- **Purpose**: Speeds up time-based filtering and ordering
- **Impact**: Optimizes 24-hour trend analysis queries

#### EXISTS Subquery Optimization
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_flights_exists_optimization 
ON flights(callsign, last_updated);
```
- **Purpose**: Optimizes EXISTS clauses in flight_records_with_atc CTE
- **Impact**: Reduces subquery execution time

### 4. Performance Monitoring Indexes

#### Multi-Purpose Composite Index
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_transceivers_frequency_entity_timestamp 
ON transceivers(frequency, entity_type, timestamp);
```
- **Purpose**: Alternative index path for frequency matching
- **Impact**: Provides query planner flexibility

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Query Execution Time
- **Before**: Potential sequential scans on large tables
- **After**: Index-only scans and efficient JOINs
- **Estimated Improvement**: 10-100x faster depending on data size

### Specific Optimizations by Query Pattern

#### 1. Individual Aircraft Analysis
- **Optimized**: Flight record counting by callsign
- **Benefit**: Faster pagination and sorting

#### 2. Position-Based Analysis  
- **Optimized**: Controller position classification
- **Benefit**: Faster CASE statement evaluation

#### 3. Time Series Analysis
- **Optimized**: Hourly aggregation queries
- **Benefit**: Faster time-based filtering

#### 4. Overall Statistics
- **Optimized**: Cross-table JOIN performance
- **Benefit**: Faster dashboard load times

## Index Storage Impact

### Estimated Index Sizes
- **Small Indexes** (< 50MB): `idx_transceivers_entity_type`, `idx_controllers_position`
- **Medium Indexes** (50-200MB): `idx_controllers_facility_callsign`, `idx_flights_callsign_last_updated_count`
- **Large Indexes** (> 200MB): `idx_transceivers_freq_pos_time`, `idx_transceivers_frequency_entity_timestamp`

### Total Storage Overhead
- **Estimated**: 500MB - 2GB additional storage
- **Justification**: Critical for dashboard performance with large datasets

## Maintenance Considerations

### 1. Index Monitoring
- Monitor index usage with `pg_stat_user_indexes`
- Identify unused indexes for potential removal
- Track index bloat and rebuild as needed

### 2. Statistics Updates
- Automatic `ANALYZE` runs after index creation
- Regular statistics updates recommended for optimal query planning

### 3. Partitioning Considerations
- Consider partitioning `transceivers` table by timestamp for very large datasets
- Evaluate monthly or weekly partitions based on data retention

## Query Plan Verification

### Before Optimization
```
Seq Scan on transceivers (cost=0.00..50000.00 rows=1000000)
  Filter: (entity_type = 'flight')
```

### After Optimization
```
Index Scan using idx_transceivers_entity_type (cost=0.43..1000.00 rows=50000)
  Index Cond: (entity_type = 'flight')
```

## Dashboard Impact

1. **Pie Chart**: Faster position type aggregation
2. **Statistics Table**: Improved sorting and filtering
3. **Individual Aircraft Table**: Faster pagination
4. **Time Series**: Optimized hourly aggregation
5. **Stat Panels**: Faster overall statistics calculation

### User Experience

- **Refresh Rate**: Can support more frequent updates
- **Interactivity**: Faster filtering and drilling down

## Future Optimizations

### 1. Materialized Views

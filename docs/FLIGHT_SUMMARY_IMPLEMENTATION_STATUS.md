## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core tables implemented and tested
flight_summaries: Summary records with JSONB fields for flexible data
flights_archive: Detailed position history with proper indexing
flights: Main table with optimized queries
```

### Code Structure (Refactored)
```python
# Main orchestration method
async def process_completed_flights() -> dict:
    # Coordinates the entire workflow
    
# Focused helper methods
async def _identify_completed_flights(completion_hours: int) -> List[dict]
async def _create_flight_summaries(completed_flights: List[dict]) -> int
async def _archive_completed_flights(completed_flights: List[dict]) -> int
async def _delete_completed_flights(completed_flights: List[dict]) -> int
async def _cleanup_old_archived_records(retention_hours: int) -> int
```

### Configuration Management
```python
# Environment-based configuration with validation
FLIGHT_COMPLETION_HOURS: 14      # Hours after logon to mark complete
FLIGHT_RETENTION_HOURS: 168     # Hours to keep archived data (7 days)
FLIGHT_SUMMARY_INTERVAL: 60     # Minutes between processing (1 hour)
FLIGHT_SUMMARY_ENABLED: true    # Enable/disable the system
```

## Configuration Reference

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Flight Summary System
FLIGHT_COMPLETION_HOURS=14        # Hours to wait before processing
FLIGHT_RETENTION_HOURS=168       # Hours to keep archived data
FLIGHT_SUMMARY_INTERVAL=60       # Minutes between processing runs
FLIGHT_SUMMARY_ENABLED=true      # Enable/disable the system
```

### Docker Configuration
```yaml
# Already configured in docker-compose.yml
environment:
  FLIGHT_COMPLETION_HOURS: 14
  FLIGHT_RETENTION_HOURS: 168
  FLIGHT_SUMMARY_INTERVAL: 60
  FLIGHT_SUMMARY_ENABLED: "true"
```

## Current Limitations

### ❌ **API Access Issues**
- **No Public Endpoints**: Flight summaries cannot be accessed via API
- **No Manual Processing**: Cannot trigger processing manually
- **No Status Monitoring**: Cannot check processing status
- **No Analytics**: Cannot view or analyze completed flights

### ⚠️ **Workarounds (Development Only)**
- **Database Direct Access**: Can query `flight_summaries` table directly
- **Background Processing**: Automatic processing continues every 60 minutes
- **Log Monitoring**: Can monitor processing via Docker logs
- **Manual Database Queries**: Can manually inspect results

## Files That Can Be Deleted (Optional)
If you want to completely remove all traces of vertical speed from the project, you can delete these summary documents:
- `VERTICAL_SPEED_REMOVAL_SUMMARY.md`
- `MODELS_AND_DATABASE_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md`
- `DOCUMENTATION_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

However, keeping them provides a historical record of the changes made.

## üìä **Data Processing Decisions**

### DP-004: Flight Plan Data Quality
**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented  
**Context**: Need to handle flights that connect to VATSIM without filing flight plans.

**Options Considered**:
- Filter out all flights without flight plans
- Keep all flights regardless of flight plan status
- Filter only flights that never depart (no position updates)
- Hybrid approach with different handling for different scenarios

**Decision**: Keep all flights without flight plans, but consider removing those that never depart.

**Rationale**:
- Many legitimate flights connect without filing flight plans
- Some pilots file plans after connecting
- Flights without position updates are likely abandoned connections
- Maintains data completeness while filtering obvious noise

**Implementation**:
- All flights tracked regardless of flight plan presence
- Position updates determine if flight is active
- Flights without position updates after connection are candidates for cleanup
- Flight plan fields remain nullable in database schema

**Consequences**:
- Higher data volume but more complete coverage
- Need to handle flights with missing departure/arrival information
- Analytics must account for incomplete flight plan data
- Real-time tracking works for all connected aircraft

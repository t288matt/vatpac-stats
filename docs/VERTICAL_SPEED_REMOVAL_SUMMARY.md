# Vertical Speed Removal Summary

## Overview
All references to vertical speed have been completely removed from the VATSIM Data Collection System application.

## Files Modified

### 1. Database Schema
- **`database/init.sql`**: Removed `vertical_speed INTEGER` column from flights table
- **`tools/create_write_optimized_tables.sql`**: Removed vertical_speed from write-optimized table creation

### 2. Application Models
- **`app/models.py`**: Removed `vertical_speed = Column(Integer, nullable=True)` from Flight model

### 3. API Endpoints
- **`app/main.py`**: Removed vertical_speed from all API responses and SQL queries

### 4. Data Processing
- **`app/services/data_service.py`**: 
  - Removed `_calculate_vertical_speed()` method
  - Removed vertical speed calculation logic from `_process_flights_in_memory()`
  - Updated method documentation

### 5. Schema Validation
- **`app/utils/schema_validator.py`**: Removed vertical_speed from field validation

### 6. Grafana Dashboards
- **`grafana/dashboards/sydney-flights.json`**: Removed vertical_speed from SQL query
- **`grafana/dashboards/sydney-flights-fixed.json`**: Removed vertical_speed from SQL query

### 7. Documentation
- **`VATSIM_API_MAPPING_TABLES.md`**: Removed vertical_speed mapping entry
- **`DATABASE_AUDIT_REPORT.md`**: Removed vertical_speed from field list
- **`docs/FLIGHT_TRACKING_ENHANCEMENT.md`**: Removed vertical_speed from API response example

### 8. Test Files
- **`scripts/test_vertical_speed.py`**: **DELETED** - No longer needed

## Impact

### Database Changes
- The `flights` table no longer has a `vertical_speed` column
- Existing data with vertical_speed values will be lost (this field was not provided by VATSIM API anyway)

### API Changes
- All flight-related API endpoints no longer return `vertical_speed` field
- SQL queries have been updated to exclude vertical_speed

### Grafana Dashboards
- Sydney flights dashboards no longer display vertical speed column
- Queries have been simplified to only show available data

## Verification
- ✅ No remaining `vertical_speed` references found in codebase
- ✅ No remaining `vertical speed` references found in codebase
- ✅ All database schema files updated
- ✅ All API endpoints updated
- ✅ All documentation updated

## Notes
- The VATSIM API v3 does not provide vertical speed data, so this removal aligns with actual API capabilities
- The vertical speed calculation was previously implemented but was not based on real VATSIM data
- This change simplifies the data model and removes unnecessary complexity

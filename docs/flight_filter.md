# Flight Geographic Filtering System

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for implementing a configurable geographic filter to filter out flights that don't pass through a defined polygon area at any point during their flight.

## Requirements

### 1. Geographic Area Definition
- **Type**: Polygon area defined by multiple lat/long coordinate points
- **Configuration**: Environment variables for easy modification without code changes
- **Format**: Array of coordinate pairs defining the polygon boundary

### 2. Filtering Criteria
- **Inclusion Logic**: Keep flights that will pass through the defined polygon area at ANY point during their flight
- **Exclusion Logic**: Discard flights that will never enter the polygon area during their entire flight
- **Determination Method**: Check current position, planned route waypoints, and trajectory analysis

### 3. Processing Location
- **Stage**: Apply filter immediately after receiving data from VATSIM API
- **Timing**: Before any database operations or further processing
- **Purpose**: Early filtering to reduce processing load and storage requirements
- **Architecture**: Separate pre-processor component, not integrated with existing services

### 4. Flight Analysis
The system should consider:
- **Current Position**: Aircraft's current lat/long coordinates
- **Planned Route**: All waypoints in the flight plan
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Predict if the flight path will intersect with the polygon area
- **Time-based Analysis**: Consider the entire flight duration, not just current position

### 5. Configuration
- **Method**: Environment variables for polygon coordinates
- **Example**: `GEO_FILTER_POLYGON="[[lat1,lon1],[lat2,lon2],[lat3,lon3],...]"`
- **Validation**: Ensure polygon is properly closed and valid

### 6. Disposition of Filtered Flights
- **Action**: Completely discard flights outside the polygon area
- **No Storage**: Do not store filtered-out flights in any database tables
- **No Processing**: Do not apply any further processing to discarded flights

## Technical Implementation Considerations

### Architecture Requirements
- **Separation**: Filter should be implemented as a standalone pre-processor component
- **Modularity**: No integration with existing services - operates independently
- **Interface**: Clean API interface for receiving VATSIM data and returning filtered results
- **Deployment**: Can be deployed as separate container/service if needed

### Performance Requirements
- **Speed**: Filtering must be fast enough to not delay data ingestion
- **Memory**: Efficient polygon intersection algorithms
- **Scalability**: Handle high volume of flight data

### Algorithm Requirements
- **Point-in-Polygon**: Determine if current position is inside polygon
- **Line-Polygon Intersection**: Check if flight path intersects with polygon
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Predict future flight path and intersection points

### Error Handling
- **Invalid Coordinates**: Handle malformed coordinate data
- **Missing Flight Data**: Handle flights with incomplete position/route information
- **Configuration Errors**: Validate polygon configuration on startup

## Environment Variables Structure

```bash
# Polygon coordinates as JSON array of [lat,lon] pairs
GEO_FILTER_POLYGON="[[-37.8136,144.9631],[-37.8136,145.9631],[-36.8136,145.9631],[-36.8136,144.9631],[-37.8136,144.9631]]"

# Enable/disable the filter
GEO_FILTER_ENABLED="true"

# Logging level for filter operations
GEO_FILTER_LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
```

## Success Criteria
1. Flights that will pass through the polygon area are retained for processing
2. Flights that will never enter the polygon area are completely discarded
3. Filtering occurs before any database operations
4. Configuration can be changed via environment variables
5. System performance is not significantly impacted by filtering
6. Proper logging of filtering decisions for monitoring

## Implementation Structure

### Component Design
- **Filter Service**: Standalone service with clear input/output interface
- **Configuration Module**: Separate configuration management for polygon settings
- **Geometric Engine**: Dedicated module for polygon intersection calculations
- **Logging Module**: Independent logging for filter operations and decisions

### Integration Points
- **Input**: Receives raw VATSIM API data
- **Output**: Returns filtered flight data to main processing pipeline
- **Configuration**: Environment variables for polygon definition
- **Monitoring**: Separate metrics and health checks

## Future Enhancements
- Support for multiple polygon areas
- Dynamic polygon updates without restart
- More sophisticated trajectory prediction algorithms
- Integration with flight plan analysis tools

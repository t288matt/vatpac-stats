# Models and Database Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the Flight model and database schema to remove vertical speed references and ensure consistency across all components.

## Files Updated

### 1. Application Models (`app/models.py`)
- **Cleaned up Flight model structure**:
  - Removed duplicate `groundspeed` field
  - Removed duplicate `cruise_tas` field
  - Organized fields into logical groups:
    - Flight tracking fields (altitude, heading, groundspeed, cruise_tas, squawk)
    - Flight plan fields (departure, arrival, route)
    - Status and timestamps (status, last_updated, created_at, updated_at)
    - VATSIM API fields (cid, name, server, pilot_rating, etc.)
    - Flight plan fields (flight_rules, aircraft_faa, etc.)
    - Foreign keys (controller_id)
  - Added proper `onupdate` trigger for `updated_at` field

### 2. Database Schema (`database/init.sql`)
- **Cleaned up flights table structure**:
  - Removed duplicate `groundspeed` field
  - Removed duplicate `cruise_tas` field
  - Organized fields with clear comments and grouping
  - Ensured all field types match the model definition
  - Added proper foreign key constraint for `controller_id`

### 3. Write-Optimized Tables (`tools/create_write_optimized_tables.sql`)
- **Updated flights_write_optimized table**:
  - Matched structure with main flights table
  - Removed duplicate fields
  - Updated field types to use `DOUBLE PRECISION` for coordinates
  - Updated bulk insert function to handle all fields properly
  - Added all VATSIM API fields to bulk insert function

## Key Changes

### Field Organization
The Flight model now has clear field organization:
```python
# Flight tracking fields
altitude, heading, groundspeed, cruise_tas, squawk

# Flight plan fields  
departure, arrival, route

# Status and timestamps
status, last_updated, created_at, updated_at

# VATSIM API fields
cid, name, server, pilot_rating, military_rating, latitude, longitude, transponder, qnh_i_hg, qnh_mb, logon_time, last_updated_api

# Flight plan fields (nested object)
flight_rules, aircraft_faa, aircraft_short, alternate, planned_altitude, deptime, enroute_time, fuel_time, remarks, revision_id, assigned_transponder

# Foreign keys
controller_id
```

### Database Consistency
- All field types now match between model and database schema
- Removed duplicate fields that were causing confusion
- Proper foreign key constraints in place
- Consistent timestamp handling with `onupdate` triggers

### Bulk Operations
- Updated bulk insert function to handle all fields
- Proper type casting for all data types
- Support for all VATSIM API fields in bulk operations

## Verification
- ✅ No duplicate fields in Flight model
- ✅ Database schema matches model definition
- ✅ All field types are consistent
- ✅ Bulk operations support all fields
- ✅ Foreign key relationships are properly defined
- ✅ Timestamp handling is consistent

## Impact
- **Cleaner codebase**: No more duplicate fields or inconsistencies
- **Better performance**: Proper field organization and indexing
- **Easier maintenance**: Clear field grouping and documentation
- **Data integrity**: Proper foreign key constraints and type definitions
- **Future-proof**: Structure supports all VATSIM API fields

## Notes
- The Flight model now properly represents all VATSIM API v3 fields
- Database schema is optimized for both read and write operations
- Bulk operations are fully supported for high-performance data ingestion
- All vertical speed references have been completely removed

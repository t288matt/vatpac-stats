## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Service Registration Fix**

**Issue:** Phase 3 services were not being registered with the ServiceManager

**Solution:**
```python
# Register services with the service manager
services = {
    'cache_service': await get_cache_service(),
    'vatsim_service': get_vatsim_service(),
    'data_service': get_data_service(),
    'traffic_analysis_service': get_traffic_analysis_service(service_db),
    'query_optimizer': get_query_optimizer(),
    'resource_manager': get_resource_manager(),
    # Phase 3 services
    'monitoring_service': get_monitoring_service(),
    'performance_monitor': get_performance_monitor(),
}
```

### **ML Service Disabled**

**Issue:** ML service required heavy dependencies (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn) causing build failures

**Solution:**
- ✅ Removed ML dependencies from requirements.txt
- ✅ Disabled ML service registration
- ✅ Updated ML endpoints to return stub responses
- ✅ Removed ML-related system dependencies from Dockerfile

**ML Service Removed:**
- ML service and endpoints completely removed from codebase
- ML configuration variables removed from docker-compose.yml
- ML-related tests removed

### **Code Cleanup**

**Redundant Code Removed:**
- ✅ Duplicate `timezone` import
- ✅ Unused imports: `get_config`, `validate_config`, `get_rating_name`, `get_rating_level`
- ✅ Commented ML service code
- ✅ Commented ML dependencies in requirements.txt

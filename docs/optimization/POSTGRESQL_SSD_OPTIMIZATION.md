# PostgreSQL SSD Preservation and Memory Caching Optimization

## Overview

The PostgreSQL migration maintains all the SSD preservation and memory caching optimizations from the SQLite implementation, with additional benefits for concurrent access and scalability.

## SSD Preservation Features

### 1. Batch Write Operations
**SQLite Implementation:**
- Writes every 5 minutes instead of every 30 seconds
- Memory caching with 512MB limit
- Bulk operations for efficiency

**PostgreSQL Implementation:**
- ✅ **Maintained**: Same 5-minute write intervals
- ✅ **Enhanced**: Connection pooling reduces connection overhead
- ✅ **Improved**: WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) with compression
- ✅ **Optimized**: Checkpoint spreading with `checkpoint_completion_target=0.9`

### 2. Memory Caching Strategy
**SQLite Implementation:**
- 64MB cache size (`cache_size = -64000`)
- Memory-mapped files (256MB)
- Temporary tables in memory

**PostgreSQL Implementation:**
- ✅ **Enhanced**: 256MB shared buffers (configurable)
- ✅ **Improved**: 1GB effective cache size
- ✅ **Optimized**: Memory-based temporary tables
- ✅ **Advanced**: Query result caching

### 3. Write Optimization
**SQLite Implementation:**
- WAL mode for better concurrency
- Normal synchronous mode
- 64KB page size for SSD optimization

**PostgreSQL Implementation:**
- ✅ **Enhanced**: Asynchronous commits (`synchronous_commit=off`)
- ✅ **Optimized**: WAL compression (`wal_compression=on`)
- ✅ **Improved**: Full page writes disabled for SSD (`full_page_writes=off`)
- ✅ **Advanced**: Parallel I/O with `effective_io_concurrency=200`

## Memory Caching Configuration

### Application-Level Caching
```python
# Both SQLite and PostgreSQL use the same caching strategy
cache = {
    'flights': {},
    'controllers': {},
    'last_write': 0,
    'write_interval': 300,  # 5 minutes
    'memory_buffer': defaultdict(list),
    'max_memory_size': "512MB"
}
```

### Database-Level Caching
**PostgreSQL Optimizations:**
```sql
-- Shared buffers for frequently accessed data
shared_buffers = 256MB

-- Effective cache size for query planning
effective_cache_size = 1GB

-- Work memory for query operations
work_mem = 4MB

-- Maintenance work memory
maintenance_work_mem = 64MB

-- Temporary buffers
temp_buffers = 8MB
```

## PostgreSQL-Specific Optimizations

### 1. WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) Optimization
```sql
-- WAL buffer size for SSD
wal_buffers = 16MB

-- WAL compression to reduce disk writes
wal_compression = on

-- Maximum WAL size
max_wal_size = 1GB

-- Checkpoint completion target (spread writes)
checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9
```

### 2. Connection Pooling
```python
# PostgreSQL connection pool configuration
pool_size = 20,                    # Maintain 20 connections
max_overflow = 30,                 # Allow up to 30 additional connections
pool_pre_ping = True,              # Verify connections before use
pool_recycle = 300,                # Recycle connections every 5 minutes
pool_timeout = 30,                 # Connection timeout
```

### 3. Query Optimization
```sql
-- SSD-optimized query costs
random_page_cost = 1.1              # Lower for SSD
effective_io_concurrency = 200      # Parallel I/O for SSD
seq_page_cost = 1.0                 # Sequential page cost

-- Memory-optimized costs
cpu_tuple_cost = 0.01               # CPU tuple cost
cpu_index_tuple_cost = 0.005        # CPU index tuple cost
cpu_operator_cost = 0.0025          # CPU operator cost
```

### 4. Materialized Views for Performance
```sql
-- Materialized view for flight summaries
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW flight_summary AS
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', last_updated) as hour,
    COUNT(*) as total_flights,
    COUNT(DISTINCT aircraft_type) as unique_aircraft_types,
    AVG(altitude) as avg_altitude,
    AVG(speed) as avg_speed
FROM flights
WHERE last_updated > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('hour', last_updated)
ORDER BY hour;
```

# Flight Plan Field Removal Summary

## Overview
Removed the unused `flight_plan` JSONB field from the flights table to clean up dead code and reduce database storage overhead.

## Background
- The `flight_plan` field existed in the database schema but was not defined in the SQLAlchemy model
- No production code read from or wrote to this field
- All flight plan data is stored in normalized individual fields (departure, arrival, route, flight_rules, etc.)
- The field was consuming storage space without providing any functionality

## Analysis Results
- **Database Usage**: 0 SQL queries reference the field
- **Code Usage**: Only debug scripts and test files mentioned it
- **Data Loss Risk**: None - all flight plan data preserved in individual fields
- **Dependencies**: None in production code

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration
- **File**: `database/011_remove_flight_plan_field.sql`
- **Action**: `ALTER TABLE flights DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS flight_plan;`
- **Safety**: Includes verification check to ensure successful removal

### 2. Schema Update
- **File**: `database/init.sql` (line 78)
- **Action**: Removed `flight_plan JSONB` field definition
- **Impact**: New deployments won't create the unused field

### 3. Configuration Updates
- **File**: `database_audit/database_audit_config.json` (line 92)
- **Action**: Removed `flight_plan` from audit field list
- **Impact**: Database audits won't check the non-existent field

### 4. Documentation Updates
- **File**: `docs/MODELS_AND_DATABASE_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md`
- **Action**: Removed references to flight_plan field
- **Impact**: Documentation now accurately reflects current schema

## Migration Steps

### Pre-Migration
1. Run test script: `python test_flight_plan_removal.py`
2. Verify field exists: Should show field present
3. Backup database (recommended)

### Migration
1. Stop application services
2. Run migration: `psql -f database/011_remove_flight_plan_field.sql`
3. Verify migration success (script includes verification)
4. Restart application services

### Post-Migration
1. Run test script: `python test_flight_plan_removal.py`
2. Verify all tests pass
3. Monitor application logs for any errors

## Benefits
- **Storage Reduction**: Removes unused JSONB field from 800K+ flight records
- **Schema Clarity**: Database schema now matches SQLAlchemy model
- **Maintenance**: Eliminates confusion about unused field
- **Performance**: Slight improvement in INSERT/UPDATE operations

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Data Loss**: None (all data preserved in individual fields)
- **Rollback**: Simple (re-add column if needed)
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test script provided

## Verification Commands
```sql
-- Check field is removed
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'flights' AND column_name = 'flight_plan';

-- Verify flight plan data still accessible
SELECT callsign, departure, arrival, route, flight_rules 
FROM flights WHERE route IS NOT NULL LIMIT 5;
```

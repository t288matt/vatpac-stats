# VATSIM Data Collection System - Test Framework

## 🎯 **Test Philosophy: User Outcomes, Not Technical Details**

This test framework focuses on **what users can accomplish** rather than how the system works internally. We test complete user workflows and successful outcomes, not individual components.

## 🏗️ **Staged Implementation Approach**

### **Stage 1: Foundation ✅ COMPLETED**
- **Goal**: Basic system validation with minimal effort
- **Tests**: System access, health, database connectivity, basic API endpoints
- **Files**: `test_system_health.py`, `conftest.py`
- **Focus**: Can users reach the system and is it running?

### **Stage 2: Core Functionality (Next)**
- **Goal**: Validate users can get what they need
- **Tests**: Flight data, controller data, data freshness, API responses
- **Focus**: Can users accomplish their basic goals?

### **Stage 3: Data Quality (Future)**
- **Goal**: Ensure data is reliable for analysis
- **Tests**: Flight plan completeness, position data accuracy, data integrity
- **Focus**: Is the data any good?

### **Stage 4: Geographic Filtering (Future)**
- **Goal**: Validate the core filtering functionality
- **Tests**: Filter status, data reduction, performance, configuration
- **Focus**: Does filtering work as expected?

### **Stage 5: Flight Summaries (Future)**
- **Goal**: Validate storage optimization and analytics
- **Tests**: Summary creation, storage reduction, processing performance
- **Focus**: Does the optimization system work?

### **Stage 6: Integration (Future)**
- **Goal**: End-to-end validation and performance assurance
- **Tests**: Complete workflows, performance SLA, system integration
- **Focus**: Can users complete full analysis tasks?

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.11+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- VATSIM system running locally

### **Installation**
```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -r tests/requirements.txt

# Or install individually
pip install pytest requests
```

### **Running Tests Locally**

#### **Option 1: Direct Execution**
```bash
# Run foundation tests directly
python tests/test_system_health.py
```

#### **Option 2: Pytest Framework**
```bash
# Run with pytest (recommended)
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific stage
python -m pytest tests/ -m stage1 -v

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_system_health.py -v
```

### **Running Tests in CI/CD**
Tests run automatically on GitHub Actions:
- **On every commit**: Basic validation
- **On every PR**: Full test suite
- **Results**: Shown in PR status and commit history

## 🧪 **Test Categories**

### **Foundation Tests (Stage 1)**
- **System Access**: Can users reach the API?
- **System Health**: Is the system running and responding?
- **Database**: Is the database accessible and responding?
- **API Endpoints**: Are basic endpoints working?

### **User Workflow Tests (Stage 2)**
- **Flight Data**: Can users get flight information?
- **Controller Data**: Can users get ATC positions?
- **Data Freshness**: Is data being updated recently?

### **Data Quality Tests (Stage 3)**
- **Flight Plan Completeness**: 100% of flights have required fields
- **Position Data**: Coordinates are within valid ranges
- **Data Integrity**: No obvious data corruption

### **Geographic Filtering Tests (Stage 4)**
- **Filter Status**: Is filtering enabled and working?
- **Data Reduction**: Does filtering reduce data volume?
- **Performance**: Is filtering fast enough?

### **Flight Summary Tests (Stage 5)**
- **Summary Creation**: Are summaries being generated?
- **Storage Reduction**: Is the 90% reduction claim valid?
- **Processing Performance**: Is the system processing 98+ records/second?

### **Integration Tests (Stage 6)**
- **Complete Workflows**: Can users complete full analysis tasks?
- **Performance SLA**: Do all endpoints meet response time requirements?
- **System Integration**: Do all components work together?

## ⚙️ **Configuration**

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Test configuration
TEST_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001          # System under test
TEST_API_TIMEOUT=30                          # API request timeout
TEST_WAIT_TIMEOUT=60                         # Service startup timeout
TEST_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3                        # Retry attempts for requests
TEST_RETRY_DELAY=5                           # Delay between retries
```

### **Test Markers**
```bash
# Run tests by stage
pytest -m stage1    # Foundation tests only
pytest -m stage2    # Core functionality tests only
pytest -m stage3    # Data quality tests only
# etc.
```

- **API Changes**: When user-facing endpoints change

### **When Tests DON'T Change**
- **Code Refactoring**: Internal implementation changes
- **Performance Optimizations**: Backend improvements
- **Bug Fixes**: Internal bug fixes
- **Configuration Changes**: Non-user-facing settings

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**

- ✅ System performance meets expectations
- ✅ Complete user workflows work end-to-end

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**
1. **Service Not Ready**: Increase `TEST_WAIT_TIMEOUT`
2. **API Timeouts**: Increase `TEST_API_TIMEOUT`
3. **Connection Refused**: Check if Docker services are running
4. **Test Failures**: Check system logs for errors

### **Debug Mode**
```bash
# Run with verbose output
python -m pytest tests/ -v -s

# Run specific test with debug
python -m pytest tests/test_system_health.py::SystemHealthTester::test_system_accessible -v -s
```

## 📚 **Next Steps**

1. **Stage 1 Complete**: Foundation tests are running
2. **Stage 2**: Add core functionality tests
3. **Stage 3**: Add data quality validation
4. **Stage 4**: Add geographic filtering tests
5. **Stage 5**: Add flight summary tests
6. **Stage 6**: Add integration tests

Each stage builds on the previous one, providing incremental value while maintaining simplicity and low maintenance overhead.

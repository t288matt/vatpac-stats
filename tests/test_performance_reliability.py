Stage 8: Performance & Reliability Tests

This module provides comprehensive testing of system performance,
reliability, and the main application logic that supports the VATSIM data system.

Focus Areas:
- FastAPI application startup and functionality
- Service layer performance and reliability
- Database query performance
- API endpoint response times
- System resource usage under load

# Deptime Field Integration for Flight Summaries

## Overview
This document describes the integration of the `deptime` field into the flight summaries system. The `deptime` field represents the planned departure time from the flight plan and is now stored in the `flight_summaries` table.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Update
**File**: `config/init.sql`
- Added `deptime VARCHAR(10)` field to `flight_summaries` table
- Positioned after `arrival` field for logical grouping
- Added comment: `-- Departure time from flight plan`

### 2. SQLAlchemy Model Update
**File**: `app/models.py`
- Added `deptime = Column(String(10), nullable=True)` to `FlightSummary` class
- Positioned after `arrival` field to match database schema

### 3. Data Service Update
**File**: `app/services/data_service.py`
- Added `"deptime": deptime` to `summary_data` dictionary
- Updated SQL INSERT statement to include `deptime` in both column list and VALUES
- Data source: `first_record.deptime` (same pattern as other fields)

### 4. Migration Script
**File**: `scripts/add_deptime_to_flight_summaries.sql`
- SQL script to add `deptime` column to existing `flight_summaries` tables
- Safe migration that checks if column already exists
- Adds appropriate column comment

### 5. Test Script
**File**: `test_deptime_integration.py`
- Comprehensive test script to verify integration
- Tests database schema, table structure, and data access
- Can be run to validate the implementation

## Implementation Details

### Field Properties
- **Name**: `deptime`
- **Type**: `VARCHAR(10)`
- **Nullable**: `YES`
- **Source**: VATSIM API `flight_plan.deptime` field
- **Position**: After `arrival` field in table schema

### Data Flow
1. VATSIM API provides `deptime` in flight plan data
2. Data is stored in `flights` table during processing
3. When creating flight summaries, `deptime` is extracted from `first_record.deptime`
4. Field is included in `summary_data` dictionary
5. SQL INSERT statement includes `deptime` in both columns and values
6. Field is stored in `flight_summaries` table

### API Impact
- **No breaking changes**: Existing API endpoints continue to work
- **Automatic inclusion**: New `deptime` field is automatically available in responses
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing flight summaries remain accessible (with NULL deptime)

## Usage

### Running the Migration
For existing deployments, run the migration script:
```sql
\i scripts/add_deptime_to_flight_summaries.sql
```

### Testing the Integration
Run the test script to verify everything is working:
```bash
python test_deptime_integration.py
```

### Accessing Deptime Data
The `deptime` field is now available in all flight summary queries:
```sql
SELECT callsign, departure, arrival, deptime, completion_time
FROM flight_summaries
WHERE deptime IS NOT NULL;
```

## Benefits

1. **Data Completeness**: Flight summaries now include planned departure time
2. **Analytics Enhancement**: Enable time-based analysis (departure patterns, delays)
3. **Consistency**: Aligns with flight identification logic that already uses `deptime`
4. **Future Analysis**: Foundation for departure time-based reporting and analytics

## Considerations

### Historical Data
- Existing flight summaries will have `NULL` values for `deptime`
- This is expected and doesn't affect existing functionality
- New flight summaries will include the field

### Data Quality
- Field remains nullable to handle cases where departure time isn't available
- No validation rules added (maintains existing data quality approach)
- Can be enhanced with validation in future iterations

### Performance
- No additional indexing added initially
- Field size is small (VARCHAR(10)) with minimal storage impact
- Can add indexes later if query performance requires it

## Future Enhancements

1. **Validation**: Add validation rules for deptime format (HHMM)
2. **Indexing**: Add indexes if deptime-based queries become common
3. **Analytics**: Implement departure time distribution analysis
4. **Reporting**: Add deptime-based filtering to reporting endpoints

## Verification

After implementation, verify:
- [ ] `deptime` column exists in `flight_summaries` table
- [ ] New flight summaries include `deptime` data
- [ ] API responses include the field
- [ ] No errors in flight summary processing
- [ ] Test script passes all checks

## Rollback

If issues arise, the field can be removed:
```sql
ALTER TABLE flight_summaries DROP COLUMN deptime;
```

However, this would require updating the code to remove references to the field.

Populate Global Airports Table (DEPRECATED)
==========================================

This script is now DEPRECATED. Use populate_global_airports.py instead.

The new approach:
1. Uses a single global airports table for all airports
2. Populates from airport_coordinates.json (now removed)
3. Provides better performance and maintainability

This file is kept for reference but should not be used.

[33m86e777f[m cleanup: Remove redundant health monitoring test script\n\n- Delete scripts/test_health_monitoring.py as health monitoring is now\n  integrated into the main application via Phase 3 services\n- Health monitoring endpoints are now built into the main app:\n  - /api/health/comprehensive\n  - /api/health/endpoints\n  - /api/health/database\n  - /api/health/system\n  - /api/health/data-freshness\n- The test script was redundant since health monitoring is now\n  a core feature with proper service integration\n- Keep generate_dashboard_queries.py as it's still useful for\n  Grafana dashboard configuration
